# Credit_Risk_Analysis
  LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services comapny has provided us with a dataset containg information on client's loans and associated credit information. The [data]() includes loan amounts. interest rates, annual income, income and home ownership information, as-well as personal credit information. 
  
  This respository uses jupyter notebook, specifically the pandas, imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to conduct a statistical analysis on these data and make observations about not only the dataset provided, but also the machine-learning tools being used here in the credit_risk_resampling, and credit_risk_ensemble. Models and algorithms such as RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, and ClusterCEntroids etc., will be used. The following questions about machine learning, and our data will be answered through our analysis; Which machine learning model is most accurate? Which, if any, is recommended for this purpose? What other observations can be made?
  
## Which models are best?

* Resampling Models

[**Native Random Oversampling**](Naive_Random_Oversampling.png) vs [**SMOTE Oversampling**](SMOTE_Oversampling.png) vs [**Undersampling**](Undersampling) vs [**Combination Sampling**](Combination Sampling.png)

* Ensemble Models

 **Balanced_Random_Forest_Classifier** vs **Easy_Ensemble_Adaboost_Classifier**
